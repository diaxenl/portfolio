<h1>Me, or in other words, Daniel Boyd<hr></h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>Eyo, Daniel here, software engineering major at Brigham Young University, currently somewhere between my sophomore and junior year.<br>
  At a personal level I am a very proud nerd. I have DMed several DnD campaigns, I avidly play MTG and spend more time than is worth in FFXIV and if you
  understood those acronyms I applaud you.<br></p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>LIDAR</li>
    <li>Maze runner</li>
    <li>Third thing here</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>LIDAR</h3>
  <p>The physics lab at my University needed a system that measured the distance between a small car and some barrier so
    I built a system on an arduino using a LIDAR, which is a component that uses light to measure distance. I also wrote the code to take the input from the LIDAR
    and output it into a csv file, translated into the distance speed of a cart. This could be easily adjusted and used by the students in the class if they
    needed  it.</p>
  <h3>Maze running</h3>
  <p>This was a lab in my data structures class where we were given a 3-dimensional array of 0's and 1's (pathways and walls) and I was able to put together
    an algorithm to manuever through the maze. This lead to further investigation specifically into pathfinding in video games.</p>
  <h3>Whatever the third one is</h3>
